## Adress Book with local cache

I wrote this application using angular and angular-material

Functionality

* adding/removing new contacts
* showing all contacts
* persisted data (using localstorage)

You can run this application using webpack server:
* cd addressbook
* npm install
* npm run

or if you want to build this application, you can use these commands:

* cd addressbook
* npm install
* npm build

and then the application will be in /dist dictionary
